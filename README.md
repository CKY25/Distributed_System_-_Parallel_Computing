# Haar Wavelet Image Compression using C++
This is my BMCS3003 Distributed System and Parallel Computing Assignment. This is a program that will compress an image using Haar Wavelet Image Compression algorithm with different approaches such as CPU, CUDA GPU, OpenCL GPU and OpenMP and output the binary file in Compressed_Image folder. This program will compare the efficiency of each approach and generate a graph with indicator of which is the best method to compress an image using Haar Wavelet Image compression algorithm. This program will also shows all the matrices of the image such as input bitcost, output bitcost, image dimension, image file size etc.

Steps to configure the project:
1. Download OpenCV library. For my project I am using OpenCV v4.10.0.
2. Copy and paste the whole opencv folder into the same folder where DSPC_Assignment folder and Compressed_Image folder is located at.
3. Go to opencv\build\x64\vc16\bin and copy opencv_world4100d.dll.
4. Go to DSPC_Assignment\x64\Debug and paste opencv_world4100d.dll into that folder.
5. Then you should be able to execute the DSPC_Assignment.exe.

Enjoy and any suggestions are appreciated ;)
